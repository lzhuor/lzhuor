- 👋 Hi, I’m @lzhuor  

⌨️ Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate software developer who believes that life is meant to be wonderful 🌟 and code should be intuitive 🧩.

### About Me  

- **🌍 Location:** Singapore, but always dreaming of living in the Alps areas in Europe 🏔️  
- **👨‍💼 Current Role:** Engineering Director at [Endowus.com](https://endowus.com)  
- **🎯 Interests:** Learning & exploring new technologies, skiing 🎿, music 🎵, hiking 🚶, photography 📸, and spending quality time with my family and cat 🐾.  

#### 🌟 A Note on Open Source  
Since 2022, I've been less active in open-source contributions due to a shift in focus at work. However, I genuinely miss the excitement and fulfillment of giving back to the community. Open source has been a big part of my journey, and I hope to return to it when the time is right.  

In the meantime, I try to support projects and endowment funds, paying it forward to collectively make the 🌏 a little better every year.  

### Projects  

Here are some of the projects I've been working on:  

- **[📝 Auto Size TextField](https://github.com/lzhuor/auto_size_text_field):**  
  A Flutter widget that automatically resizes text fields to fit perfectly within their bounds.  

- **[📊 React-Vis](https://github.com/uber/react-vis):**  
  A collection of data visualization components for React. I contributed to enhancing the functionality and fixing bugs in this widely-used library.  

- **[🌍 FormatJS](https://github.com/formatjs/formatjs):**  
  A modular collection of JavaScript libraries for internationalization. My contributions focused on improving localization features and documentation.  

### Fun Facts  

- **🎿 Skiing Enthusiast:**  
  I love hitting the slopes whenever I get the chance. There's nothing like the thrill of skiing down a mountain!  

- **🐱 Cat Lover:**  
  I share my space with a wonderful cat who keeps me company during late-night coding sessions.
